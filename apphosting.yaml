# خدمت:
#   # Specifies how to run the Next.js application
#   # For Next.js apps using the App Router, this typically points to the .next/standalone server
#   # or uses a command like `npm start` if your package.json is configured correctly.
#   # App Hosting will often detect this automatically for Next.js.
#   # main: node .next/standalone/server.js # Example for standalone output
#   # main: npm start # If your `npm start` script runs the Next.js production server
#   # The default behavior for Next.js should work with Firebase App Hosting.
